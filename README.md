# Port Management Library

This library can be utilized in projects related to risk assessment for ballast water. The library has a dataset which includes all ports globally and the enviromental variables related to them such as minimum, maximum yearly average and salinity of water in each port. Some ports have a formal name and some are in the middle of body of water. A general view of the port data is shown in the following image.

The ports environmental variables have been revised by subject matter experts at the Bailey lab and updated. Some fresh water salinity has been changed after revisions to make sure the dataset is an accurate representation of environmental variables.

Here is an example of ports near the Canadian border.

Note that this library will be replaced by an API in future to provide the most accurate data.
